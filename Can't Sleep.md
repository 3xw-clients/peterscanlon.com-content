# Can't Sleep?

Insomnia is a sleep disorder which can cause a person to have difficulty either falling asleep or remaining asleep. It is perhaps the most widely known sleep disorder, with between 10%-30% of adults experiencing insomnia at any given point in time. It is often accompanied by follow-on effects of disturbed or insufficient sleep: depressive mood, irritability, daytime fatigue or sleepiness. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of other conditions [link]

The effects of insomnia are a result of poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality is defined by an individual failing to reach Rapid Eye Movement,  or REM, sleep, and a consistent lack of this restful sleep can lead to the onset of serious conditions, such as major depressive disorder.
