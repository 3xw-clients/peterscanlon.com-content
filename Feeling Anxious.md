# Feeling Worried or Anxious?

Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry or unease. Everyone will feel anxious from time to time- it's a perfectly normal reaction to situations of pressure or stress. Sometimes, a small amount of anxiety can even be useful ~~to you~~, motivating you to reach a goal or complete a task. It may not even be clear to you what it is in your life that is causing your anxiety, leading you to believe it to be unprompted or placing the blame at the wrong source. Feelings of anxiety are entirely natural, and their presence alone should not be taken as an indicator of any psychological disorder.

That being said, if you do feel that you are experiencing bouts of anxiety which could be characterised as unnaturally intense, frequent or long-lasting, then it is important to try and understand the possible causes, and  effects, in a calm and rational manner.

- Those of us who experience elevated anxiety may find it more difficult to get a good night's sleep [link]
- We may find it harder to concentrate, having difficulty staying focused on one particular thing, such as work or study.
- We may experience a constant feeling of being  'on-edge', having significant trouble relaxing, or separating ourselves from anxious thoughts.
- We may find ourselves to be more irritable, quicker to anger, and more aggressive to those around us.
- We may find ourselves prone to feeling tearful, or similar expressions of distress ~~and negative emotions~~.

## What Not to Do

Feelings of anxiety, no matter than cause, can certainly be overwhelming at times. What is important, however, is to process these feelings in a healthy manner.

If you believe you are experiencing elevated anxiety:

- There is no need to ignore your feelings of anxiety entirely. Most anxiety stems from something identifiable within our lives. Try instead to recognise and acknowledge if there is a reasonable explanation for your anxiety, and work from there to resolve it positively.
- Do not resort to self-medication. Serious anxiety will not be resolved through the effects of alcohol or other drugs, and in many cases the introduction of these substances is likely to intensify the problem.
- Do not allow yourself to engage in self-destructive behaviour. Often the feeling of anxiety can be oppressive, and lead to an escapist impulse which may manifest in the form of behaviour which may be harmful or dangerous to yourself or others.

## What to Do

- Make an effort to create time in your day-to-day life to set aside your anxious feelings.
- For many people, meditation, or practising mindfulness, provides relief from the stresses of their daily life.
- Making time to socialise may help you to decompress and properly relieve built-up anxiety.
- Alternatively, finding the time during the day to be alone, at rest and at peace, may enable you to return to a state of calm after periods of pressure or stress.
- If you find yourself unable to separate from feelings of anxiety or worry, try to speak to someone who you feel knows you and can be trusted to understand your problem, be they a friend, partner or family member.
- If you find yourself unable to cope with your anxiety, or suspect yourself  to be struggling with some form of anxiety disorder, seeking professional help may be in your best interests long-term. If you come to the decision to do so; either personally, or on the advice of a GP, it is important to understand that you may indeed have some description of anxiety disorder, but you may also simply be feeling perfectly normal or natural anxiety, but experiencing it in an overwhelming or unhealthy way. Therapy can be the key to understanding these feelings, and how to move forward in processing them.
