# Feeling Worried or Anxious ?

Anxiety is an emotion which is both common and normal. In many respects it is an umbrella term which encompasses a broad range of feelings bound up with everyday experiences and the human condition. It can incorporate a sense of being worried, uneasy, fearful, scared, unsure, alarmed, nervous, vulnerable, panicky, afraid being tense or overwhelmed (to mention but a few). The degrees to which these individually (or collectively) are experienced can vary enormously from been slightly noticeable to being perpetually tormented and confused. Similarly the frequency with which they occur can be episodic to daily and within the latter, once or twice a day to never feeling you are not without the accompanying sensations.

In this respect, everyone will feel anxious from time to time- it can be a perfectly normal reaction to situations of pressure or stress. Sometimes, a small amount of anxiety can even be useful, motivating individuals in reaching a particular goal or completing a task. Where anxiety is present, it may not always be clear as to what it is in your life that is causing you to feel the way you do. Where this is the case, it can lead you to believe the feelings are unprompted or have no origins and even place the cause of the emotions at the wrong source. As feelings of anxiety are entirely natural, their presence alone should not be taken as an indicator of any psychological disorder.

That being said, if you do feel that you are experiencing bouts of anxiety which could be characterised as uncomfortable or unnaturally intense, either frequent or long-lasting where they are an impediment to the quality of your life, then it is important to try and understand their possible causes, effects and ways of dealing more effectively with.

Those of us who experience some or much of the above;

- may find it more difficult to get a good night's sleep [link]
- may find it harder to concentrate, having difficulty staying focused on one particular thing, such as work or study.
- may experience a constant feeling of being 'on-edge', having significant trouble relaxing, or separating ourselves from anxious thoughts.
- may find ourselves to be more irritable, quicker to anger, and more aggressive to those around us (especially our family, partners or animals).
- And may find ourselves prone to feeling tearful or similar expressions of distress.

## What Not to Do

Feelings of anxiety, no matter what the explanations can certainly be frustrating and distressing at times. What is important however is to process these feelings in a manner that is healthy and productive. To be personally responsible and constructive in attending to your well-being if you are concerned;

- **Do not** ignore your mental health.
- **Do not** isolate yourself from your family, friends and or loved ones.
- **Do not** resort to self-medicating. Avoid alcohol, drugs, food, overworking, over exercising, pornography.
- **Do not** be self-destructive. Be gentle and compassionate with yourselves but above app be proactive.

## What to Do

- Make an effort to create time in your day-to-day life in an attempt to pay attention to your internal world. For many people, meditation or practising mindfulness can provide relief from the stresses of daily life.
- Make time to socialise as it can help you to decompress and properly relieve built-up anxiety (if being around others is not the problem itself â€“ social anxiety).
- Make time to engage in activities that are restful and relaxing or which you enjoy. These may enable you to return to a state of calm after periods of pressure or stress.
- Make time to exercise. The correlation between exercise and mental health is without dispute amongst professionals.
- Be mindful of your diet.
- Be open, honest and compassionate with yourself in acknowledging your humanity.
- If you find yourself unable to separate from feelings of anxiety or worry, try to speak to someone who you feel knows you and can be trusted in understanding your dilemmas or points of view, that is, be they a friend, partner, family member, parish priest, teacher or sporting coach.
- If you find yourself unable to cope with your anxiety, or suspect yourself to be struggling with some form of anxiety disorder, seeking professional help may be in your best interests in the long-term. If you come to the decision to do so; either personally, or on the advice of a GP, it is important to understand that you may indeed have an anxiety disorder or characteristics of, but you may also simply be feeling  natural anxiety, but experiencing it in an overwhelming manner. Therapy can be the key to understanding these feelings, and how to move forward in processing them.
