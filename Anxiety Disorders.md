# Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders include psychological disorders which share features of excessive fear, anxiety, and similar disturbances in one's behaviour and thinking. The key difference between fear and anxiety is that, although they may feel the same or overlap, fear is considered the response to a threat, real or perceived, which is imminent, a clear and present danger. Anxiety, on the other hand, is the anticipation of a supposed future threat. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, accelerated heart rate, or shaking.

There are many different classifications of anxiety disorders in the field of psychology. What is important to remember is that the main factor differentiating these disorders is what causes contribute to the symptoms. What's more, they are not mutually exclusive, and if you are vulnerable to anxiety disorders, you may suffer from more than one. About 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year, and between 5% and 30% are affected at some point in their life. They occur about twice as often in females as males and generally begin before the age of 25.

Typically, symptoms will need to be present for at least 6 months before an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. If you believe yourself to be suffering from an anxiety disorder, it is important to understand that without proper treatment and counselling, such disorders tend to remain.

Below is a breakdown of some of the most common anxiety disorders as well as their symptoms and warning signs. If you genuinely suspect yourself to be suffering from an anxiety disorder, please attempt to seek treatment. If you feel the need for counselling, or it has been recommended to you, feel free to make use of our Appointments Service [link]

## Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

A common disorder, characterised by a long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any single object or situation. Those suffering from GAD may find themselves in a persistent state of fear or worry without any specific cause, and become overly concerned with, and stressed by, everyday matters. This disorder is among the most likely of anxiety disorders to affect older adults.

You may be affected by Generalised Anxiety disorder if you suffer from chronic, excessive worry, accompanied by 3 or more of the following symptoms:

- Restlessness
- Fatigue
- Concentration Problems
- Irritability
- Muscle Tension
- Sleep Disturbance

If you meet these criteria, consider pursuing preliminary treatment. If you do choose to seek treatment, feel free to avail of our Appointments Service [link].

## Specific Phobias

Specific phobias encompass the single largest category of anxiety disorder, with between 5 and 12% of the population worldwide suffering from them. Typically, those living with specific phobias will anticipate that an encounter with the object of their fear will lead to terrifying consequences. Despite understanding that their fear is disproportional to the actual potential danger, the fear response is involuntary and overwhelming.

Common phobias include:

- Animal type - Fear of dogs, cats, rats and/or mice, pigs, cows, birds, spiders, or snakes.
- Natural environment type - Fear of water (aquaphobia), heights (acrophobia), lightning and thunderstorms (astraphobia), or aging (gerascophobia).
- Situational type - Fear of small confined spaces (claustrophobia), or the dark (nyctophobia).
- Blood/Injection/Injury type - this includes fear of medical procedures, including needles and injections (trypanophobia), fear of blood (hemophobia) and fear of getting injured.
- Other - children's fears of loud sounds or costumed characters.

The DSMV criteria for specific phobias are as follow:

- Fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation
- The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety
- The phobic object or situation is avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety
- The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation
- The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more
- The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in one's social life, work, home environment, or other important areas of functioning
- The disturbance is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder including: Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Separation Anxiety, or Social Anxiety Disorder.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is seen as an effective treatment for sufferers of specific phobias. It is a short-term therapy that aims to help diffuse unhelpful emotional responses in patients. If you are suffering from phobic symptoms, and are seeking therapeutic aid in relieving them, please feel free to avail of our Appointments Service [link].

## Panic Disorder

Panic Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterised by the presence of frequent or reoccurring and unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are periods of intense fear marked by symptoms which may include: palpitations, shaking, sweating, shortness of breath, numbness, or severe anxious feelings that something terrible is about to occur. The most intense periods of these attacks will typically take place within minutes.

The essential feature is recurrent attacks of severe anxiety (panic), which are not restricted to any particular situation or circumstance and are thus unpredictable.

The dominant symptoms include:

- sudden onset of palpitations
- chest pain
- choking sensations
- Dizziness
- feelings of unreality (depersonalization or derealization)
- secondary fear of dying, losing control, or going mad

Panic Disorder is a serious, yet treatable health disorder. Several therapy techniques can produce positive results after continued application. If you suffer from, or are suspected to suffer from, Panic Disorder, it is strongly encouraged that you seek medical or psychological treatment. If you do decide to seek treatment, feel free to avail of our Appointments Service [link].

## Social Anxiety Disorder
Social anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of one or more social situations where embarrassment may occur and the fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation. Typical social situations can be grouped into those that involve interaction, observation and performance. These include:

- Meeting people including strangers
- Talking in meetings or in groups
- Starting conversations, talking to authority figures
- Working, eating or drinking while being observed
- Going to school, shopping, being seen in public
- Using public toilets
- Public performance including speaking

While anxiety about some of the above is common in the general population, people with social anxiety disorder can worry excessively about them and can do so for weeks in advance of an anticipated social situation.

The first line treatment for SAD is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If you are interested in pursuing therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder, please feel free to avail of our Appointments Service [link].

## Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to exceptionally threatening or horrifying events. Many people show remarkable resilience and capacity to recover following exposure to trauma. PTSD is present in approximately 3% of the population at any one time, and can occur after a single traumatic event or from prolonged exposure to trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood. Predicting who will go on to develop PTSD is a challenge. Patients with PTSD are at an increased risk of developing both poor physiological health and simultaneous psychological disorders.

Signs that an individual may be experiencing PTSD include:
- Vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares, typically accompanied by strong and overwhelming emotions such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations
- Avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events
- Avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event or events
- Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated, or worthless
- Deep feelings of shame, guilt, or failure related to the stressor
- Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others

Clinical guidelines recommend trauma-focused psychological therapies when treating PTSD. If you or someone know is affected by this disorder, it is strongly recommend that counselling be sought. Sessions are available through our Appointments Service [link].
