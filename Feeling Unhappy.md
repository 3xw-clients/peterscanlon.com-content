# Feeling Unhappy, in a Low-Mood or Depressed?

Depression is an emotional state characterised by feelings of sadness, pessimism, or hopelessness, and by an overall low mood. Depression is, first and foremost, one of the many natural states of reaction in the human condidtion as a response to internal external experiences. For example, by way of external events, if you undergo a personal loss, be it of a loved one, a job, a marriage, your own health, or anything that is personally important to you, it is entirely natural and normal to have an emotional response which results in the onset of lowered mood or depressed affect.

When characterising depression as a disorder, there are a few things to be mindful of, the first being that, in clinical terms, there is no disorder simply called "depression". While a state of depression is certainly challenging and can often result (and usually does) in difficulties with coping, that does not in and of itself mean there is anything 'abnormal' about your state of mind or your feelings. To this end, there is nothing wrong with seeking help, either in your personal life, or professionally, and doing so is not a sure sign of any wider or more problematic psychological concerns.

If, on the other hand, you suspect that you may be experiencing lowered mood or depressed affect as a result of any kind of difficulty (no matter how frivolous you perceive this to be) some signs to watch for include:

- Persistent, long-lasting feelings of sadness, emptiness, worthlessness, inappropriate guilt, self-loathing, or hopelessness.
- Loss of interest or motivation in normal activities; hobbies, socialising, sport, sex, work, studies, etc.
- Disturbances in your sleeping pattern (including both oversleeping and insomnia), or tiredness, fatique or lack of energy
- Reduced appetite which could result in weight loss or alternatively increased food cravings (and possible weight gain).
- Frequent and recurring thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts.
- Diminished ability to think or concentrate, as either noticed by self or by others.
- Changes in behaviour as observed by others (it is useful to remember, we can be blind onto ourselves).

# What not to do?

- **Do Not** attempt to self medicate with drugs or alcohol.
  - Be particularly careful with cannabis. Though it may seem harmless, regular use may lead to worsened symptoms.
- **Do Not** attempt to ignore your symptoms. Most lowered mood and depressed affect stems from dimensions to our inner worlds which are not always either apparent and or easily identifiable. The depressed state is a way of our deeper selves communicating 'all is not well' and is a means of manifesting our requirement for support and assistance.
- **Do Not** treat persistent suicidal thoughts as "normal" or being unhappy as the way to live life.
- **Do not** isolate yourself from your family, friends and or loved ones.
- **Do not** retreat to pornography, gambling, over-exercising, food, shopping or spending each and every moment on line.
- **Do Not** verwork yourself or take on additional pressures.
- **Do Not** engage in self-harm.

# What to do?

- Attempt to regulate your sleeping pattern.
- Make an effort to get out of the house for a few hours each day.
- Make time to socialise.
- Make time to exercise. The correlation between exercise and mental health is without dispute amongst professionals.
- Try to avoid depressant substances such as alcohol.
- Check the side effects of any medication you are taking.
- If symptoms persist for most of the day, every day, for over two weeks, seek advice from your GP.
- If you find yourself unable to cope with a depressive disorder, seeking professional help may be in your best interests long-term. Medication and the psychological therapies work differently on the central nervous system and psyche. The research indicates combined they are an effective approach to well-being.
- Be open, honest and compassionate with yourself in acknowledging your humanity and in recognising adult life is extremely difficult to navigate and you can expect to 'get lost' a few times over an 80 plus year period.
- Make time to engage in activities that are restful and relaxing or which you enjoy. These may enable you to return to a state of calm after periods of pressure or stress.
- Be mindful of your diet.
- If you find yourself unable to separate from a persistent unhappiness, try to speak to someone who you feel knows you and can be trusted in understanding your dilemmas or points of view, that is, be they a friend, partner, family member, parish priest, teacher or sporting coach.
