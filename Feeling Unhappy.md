# Feeling Unhappy or Depressed?

Depression is an emotional state characterised by feelings of sadness, pessimism, or hopelessness, and by an overall low mood. Depression is, first and foremost, one of the many natural states of reaction in the human mind as a response to external stimuli;If you undergo a personal loss, be it of a loved one, a job, a marriage, your own health, or anything that is personally important to you, it is entirely natural for your mind to react with depression.

When characterising depression as a disorder, there are a few things to be mindful of, the first being that, in clinical terms, there is no disorder called simply "depression". While a state of depression may be difficult to undergo, and perhaps you may have difficulty processing or coping with it, that does not in and of itself mean that there is anything 'abnormal' about your state of mind or your feelings. There is nothing wrong with seeking help, either in your personal life, or professionally, and doing so is not a sure sign of any wider or more serious psychological ailment.

If, on the other hand, you suspect that you may be experiencing depression as a result of a deeper underlying psychological problem, some signs to watch for include:

- Persistent, long-lasting feelings of sadness, emptiness, worthlessness, guilt, self-loathing, or hopelessness.
- Loss of interest or motivation in normal activities; hobbies, socialising, sport, sex, work, studies, etc.
- Disturbances in your sleeping pattern (including both oversleeping and insomnia), or tiredness/lack of energy
- Reduced appetite/weight loss or increased food cravings/weight gain
- Frequent/Recurring thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts or ideation, suicide attempts

- Be particularly careful with cannabis. Though it may seem harmless, regular use may lead to worsened symptoms
- Do Not attempt to ignore your symptoms
