# Sleep Disorders

Sleep Disorders (or _somnipathies_), are a category of medical and psychological disorder which affect the sleep  pattern. They may be caused by a variety of outside issues, including substance abuse, bruxism (teeth grinding), physical irregularities such as a deviated septum, or psychological phenomena such as night terrors. If you experience severe difficulty in falling asleep, or in remaining asleep throughout the night, without an obvious cause, you may be suffering from a condition known as insomnia. Other common sleep disorders include narcolepsy, hypersomnia, sleep apnea, sleepwalking, and bed-wetting.

## Insomnia

Insomnia may manifest as either an inability to initiate or maintain sleep. In addition, the DSM-V criteria for insomnia diagnoses include:

- The lack of sleep causing significant problems in your work, education or social life.
- The difficulties in sleeping occurring at least 3 times a week.
- The problem occurs despite there being sufficient opportunities for you to get a full night's sleep.
- The insomnia is not a result of an outside disorder such as sleep apnea or a breathing disorder.

Insomnia can be further classified by three types:

- **Transient:** Lasts for less than a week. Can be caused by simultaneous factors, such as severe stress or depression. May be the result of a change in sleeping situation.
- **Acute:** Consistent disturbed sleeping pattern for over one week and less than one month, resulting in difficulties functioning during the day.
- **Chronic:** Lasting for beyond one month consistently, chronic insomnia may be a primary disorder, or potentially the result of another underlying disorder. Possible effects include consistent muscular weariness or fatigued/impaired mental functions. In more extreme cases, double vision or hallucinations can be the result of chronic insomnia.

If you have been experiencing insomnia for an extended period of time without explanation, and have already attempted our guidelines regarding troubled sleep, you may be in need of professional therapeutic aid, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy.

## Night Terror

Night terror(s) is a sleep disorder, typically occurring within the non-REM stages of sleep, which causes the sufferer to experience feelings of terror or dread. This disorder most commonly occurs between the ages of twenty to thirty for adults, or three to twelve for children. Individual cases may vary greatly in levels of severity, and may occur in frequencies ranging from days to weeks in intervals, or night-to-night. The criteria for identifying night terrors include:

- Recurring instances of waking suddenly or abruptly, accompanied by screaming.
- Physical indicators of fear, such as sweating, rapid heart-rate, shortness of breath.
- An inability to be calmed or rationally soothed in the wake of the experience.
- Inability to recall specific details of the dream.
- Serious impact on the individual's life due to distress and/or sleep deprivation resulting from the episodes.

Counselling has been found to be helpful as an alternative to prescription medication in many cases.

## Sleepwalking

_Somnambulism_, or sleepwalking, is part of a category of sleep disorders known as parasomnias, which centre around involuntary, unconscious and irregular movements and behaviours that occur during sleep. Sleepwalking can vary in severity from sitting up in bed or walking to the bathroom to more hazardous scenarios such as attempts at cooking. Generally, sleepwalkers will perform simple, repetitive actions, and will have little or no memory of this occurring after waking. Sleepwalking is often benign in nature, although more active cases will be  at greater risk of minor or sometimes major injury during this vulnerable state.
